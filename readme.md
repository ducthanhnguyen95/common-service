Say you are implementing an app a team uses to manage their tasks.<br> 
One of the appâ€™s features is allowing the users to leave comments for the tasks. When a user publishes a comment, it is stored somewhere (e.g., in a database), and the app sends an email to a specific address configured in the app.<br>
We need to design the objects and find the right responsibilities and abstractions for implementing this feature
